# image_watermarking
A Python project which automatically puts watermark into multiple images.

## October 22, 2021
My third project in the series. I had to learn a image processsing library called Pillow to create this project. Instead of using tkinter as the UI, I uploaded it in the internet and used my existing knowledge in flask and web development to make the project publicly available.

### Learnings
Studying never stops. We should strive to learn something new everyday.
